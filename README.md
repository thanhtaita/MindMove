#MindMove

My project is called “MindMove,” where I majorly created a website and a game for the website. Basically, this is a website of a dancing Academy, which I imagine, 
called MindMove. MindMove is a place where people can come and register for dancing classes and workshops. My first intention for the final project is to create
something related to my dancing hobby, which has contributed significantly to my personal growth and personality. Back in Vietnam, I was an active member of a dancing
organization called “B2C - Bound The Crush,” They are also my big inspiration for this project. B2C usually has weekly private workshops for members, which has been 
growing fast recently. B2C has a strong design team among all the dancing organizations in Vietnam (I attached the link below you can take a look at it), where people 
come together to create and appreciate the beauty of art. As a second-year computer science student, I’m thinking about contributing to building a website for B2C, 
a place to introduce the organization’s brand to become a business potentially. That’s why the last ART 151 project is a chance for me to start this plan. I try to use
colors that express my personality, a little dark theme, contrast colors, and minimalism on this website. I also have two versions of a game where students can come 
and practice to expand their dancing knowledge. One version is a beta version which is less difficult than the actual one. By playing this tutorial game, students, 
or even potential customers, can gain points for receiving gifts or discounts when purchasing plans from MindMove. I built this game but not any other kind of promotion
because it can help boost the website’s engagement, and it also can be a game that people can play daily to learn and practice their dancing skills. Compared to sending
emails to customers to let them get random promotions, I think this game is also an effective way, or even better, for the business to build its brand and gain customer
engagement. I will not spoil more details, so you can have a whole experience when you play it. The game links are on the first page of the website. You can simply 
click the buttons “Beta Tutorial Game” or “Tutorial Game” to start playing. I added sound into the game, but sometimes it just does not work for some reasons 
I don’t know. Have fun playing it.
