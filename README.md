#MindMove

My project is titled 'MindMove,' and it primarily involves the development of a website and an accompanying game. MindMove is essentially an online platform designed to serve as a hub for a dancing academy of the same name. It provides individuals with the opportunity to register for dancing classes and workshops. My primary motivation behind this project is my passion for dancing, which has had a profound impact on my personal growth and character development.

During my time in Vietnam, I was an active member of a dance organization called 'B2C - Bound The Crush,' which also serves as a significant source of inspiration for my project. B2C regularly conducts private workshops for its members, and it has experienced rapid growth in recent times. B2C is renowned for its exceptional design team within the Vietnamese dance community (I have provided a link below for your reference), where individuals come together to create and appreciate the art of dance. As a web developer, I saw an opportunity to contribute to B2C's growth by creating a website that could help establish the organization as a potential business entity. I aimed to incorporate colors that reflect my personal style, employing a slightly darker theme, contrasting color schemes, and a minimalist design approach in the website's development.

Additionally, I developed two versions of a dancing game that students could use to enhance their dancing knowledge. The first version serves as a tutorial, providing a less challenging experience compared to the actual game. By engaging with this tutorial, students and potential customers have the chance to earn points, which they can redeem for gifts or discounts when purchasing dance class plans from MindMove. I chose to develop this game as a means of increasing engagement with the website while also providing a daily learning and practice tool for aspiring dancers.

In comparison to traditional methods of sending promotional emails to customers, I believe this game offers a more effective way to build the MindMove brand and engage customers. To avoid giving away too many details, I invite you to explore the full experience by playing the game. You can access the game links on the first page of the website by simply clicking on the buttons labeled 'Beta Tutorial Game' or 'Tutorial Game.' Please note that sound has been integrated into the game, although it may not function properly at times for reasons beyond my control.

I hope you enjoy playing the game and exploring the MindMove website.
